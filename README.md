# Oh hi,👋 come in, take in the aroma of gumbo. I still have some on the stove.🍲

### Grab yourself a bowl,🥣 and have a seat if you would like.🪑 Allow me to tell you a bit about myself.

I come from a blue collar background,🚚 and now I am seeking to make a career out of coding.📜 I am currently attending college,🎓 but I also like doing my own projects. My personal projects are gonna start simple and small such as mods for video games,🎮 but I hope to eventually contribute more complex and impactful code. If you find my contributions to be fun or useful to you, feel free to buy me a treat.🍫 I am gonna continue doing what I love, and sharing my work for others to use.

### Finished already? Just leave your bowl in the sink, I will get it.🧽

Go on, browse my repositories.🗃 I may not have much at the moment, but as I grow my coding skills, my contributions should grow too.

# Thanks for visiting, I hope to see you again soon!
